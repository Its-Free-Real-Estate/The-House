        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <br>
        <p> Before I started I had to come up with a simple but effective object </p>

        <p> to make. I decided to brouse through many idea's. One being a temple </p>

        <p> another being a shield, but I ended up deciding I wanted to make a </p>

        <p> generic small cottage. Originally, I was going to make it out of stone </p>

        <p> but when looking at images online I decided to make it out of wood </p>

        <p> because I thought It would look better. Since I was a novice at </p>

        <p> at Blender this was a challenge. When designing something I would</p>

        <p> recommend trying to find some inspiration off the internet. This made </p>

        <p> it easier for me to create because I knew what I needed to create. </p>

        <p> I chose this cottage/house because it was simple but looked nice but </p>

        <p> I made sure it looked different in some ways e.g. the windows, the </p>

        <p> bushes, and the pathway leading up to the door. Without the picture </p>

        <p> the task would have taken more time and a lot harder to complete. </p>
